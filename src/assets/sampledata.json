      "strDescriptionEN": "House of Balloons is the debut mixtape of Canadian artist, The Weeknd, released online for free in March 2011. Production was headed up by Canadian producers Doc McKinney, Zodiac, Illangelo. House of Balloons blends a range of electronic and urban genres including R&B and soul as well as incorporating dubstep tones. The title track is based on the music of the hit single \"Happy House\" by Siouxsie and the Banshees. \nUpon its release, House of Balloons garnered much acclaim among critics and fans alike.

House of Balloons received the 'Best New Music' title at Pitchfork.com. Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating based on reviews by industry professionals, gave House of Balloons a rating of 87 based on 16 reviews indicating 'Universal Acclaim,' also making it the third highest scoring R&B release ever. In December of 2011, Metacritic determined that House of Balloons was the third best-reviewed project of the year .\nAdditionally, the mixtape was featured on several music critics' and publications' end-of-year albums lists. Complex called it the \"best album of 2011;\" Stereogum ranked it number 5 ; The Guardian ranked it number 8 ; The A.V. Club ranked it number 6 ; SPIN ranked it (as well as Thursday) number 13 [14]; while Pitchfork ranked it number 10.[15] As a whole, House of Balloons was the seventh most frequently mentioned album in music publications' year-end Top Ten lists [16].\nThe mixtape was named as a longlisted nominee for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize.[17] It was later announced as a shortlisted nominee.\nThe mixtape's title track, House of Balloons, was listed on Pitchfork Media's list of top 100 songs of 2011 at number 57, while The Morning was number 15.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Kiss Land is the debut studio album by Canadian recording artist The Weeknd. The album was released in the United States on September 10, 2013, by XO and Republic Records. Kiss Land was supported by six singles: \"Kiss Land\", \"Belong to the World\", \"Love in the Sky\", \"Live For\", \"Pretty\" and \"Wanderlust\". The album's sole guest appearance comes from frequent collaborator Drake. The album's production was primarily handled by Danny Boy Styles, The Weeknd himself, and Jason \"DaHeala\" Quenneville.\n\nOn March 17, 2013, The Weeknd announced his debut album would be titled Kiss Land. In July 2013, Amazon.com revealed that the album would be released on August 27, 2013. On July 22, 2013, it was announced that the album would be pushed back from August 27, 2013, until September 10, 2013. In July 2013, during an interview with Complex, The Weeknd described the album, saying:\n\n\"Kiss Land symbolizes the tour life, but it\u2019s a world that I created in my head. Just like House of Balloons symbolizes Toronto and my experiences there, but it\u2019s a world that I created. When I think about Kiss Land, I think about a terrifying place. It\u2019s a place I\u2019ve never been to before that I\u2019m very unfamiliar with. A lot of it is inspired by filmmakers like John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and Ridley Scott, because they know how to capture fear. That\u2019s what Kiss Land is to me, an environment that\u2019s just honest fear. I don\u2019t know who I am right now and I\u2019m doing all these outlandish things in these settings that I\u2019m not familiar with. To me, it\u2019s the most terrifying thing ever. So when you hear the screams in the record and you hear all these horror references and you feel scared, listen to the music because I want you to feel what I\u2019m feeling. Kiss Land is like a horror movie.\"\n\nHe also explained the album's second single \"Belong to the World\", saying: \"Belong to the World\" is about falling in love with the wrong person. There are some songs where I talk about the same person, but I like to make every song about someone else. Thursday is a conceptual album. Whatever that situation was, I spent the whole album focusing on that situation.\" He also explained where the title Kiss Land came from, saying: \"I didn\u2019t want to call it Dark World or something so generic. The title came from a conversation that I overheard and those words stuck out. Someone said, \u201cKiss Land\u201d and I thought, \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the title of my album.\u201d It sounds so ridiculous. When I put  out everyone was like, \u201cWhat the hell? This is going to be corny. It\u2019s going to be all lovey-dovey.\" On July 21, 2013, the album cover was released. On September 1, 2013, the entire album was made available for streaming on NPR Music.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Starboy is the third studio album by Canadian singer and songwriter The Weeknd. It was released on November 25, 2016, by XO and Republic Records. The album features guest appearances from Daft Punk, Lana Del Rey, Future, and Kendrick Lamar. The album was supported by three singles: \"Starboy\", \"I Feel It Coming\" and \"Party Monster\".\n\nStarboy received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with 348,000 album-equivalent units, including 209,000 traditional album sales in the first week. It also debuted at number one on Billboard's Canadian Albums Chart.\n\nAfter the commercial success of his album Beauty Behind the Madness in 2015, The Weeknd hinted at the release of his third studio album on March 12, 2016, with his Instagram calling it the next \"chapter\" to his music. On August 24, 2016, The Weeknd was confirmed by the Republic Records executive vice president Wendy Goldstein to be collaborating with the French electronic dance duo Daft Punk, during an interview with Billboard. On September 7, 2016, the album was confirmed to be in production from an interview with VMAN, with influence taken from Prince, The Smiths, Talking Heads and Bad Brains. On September 21, 2016, the album overall and its title was officially announced, with its release slated for November 25, 2016.\n\nThe album's sleeve is photographed and designed by Nabil Elderkin. It features The Weeknd with shorter hair in a crouched pose with a cross necklace and is highlighted by streaks of blue neon across a neon red background. The top of the picture says the album's name in yellow lettering and the edges of the packaging are grained by the blue neon.",

      "strReview": "Who is the Weeknd? That\u2019s the question a lot of us asked when the act first materialized, fully-formed, with 2011\u2019s House of Balloons. Thanks to the group\u2019s savvy anti-publicity campaign, the question had a literal bent: who are the people who made these songs? Fast-forward five years and there\u2019s little mystery remaining when it comes to the provenance of the Weeknd\u2019s music\u2014like so many modern pop songs, his are now designed in consultation with a committee of experts. And yet, even as we watch Abel Tesfaye walk the red carpet in the light of day, the question remains: Who is the Weeknd? Is he a drugged-out lothario? A beloved pop star? A nihilist foil to Drake? The second coming of Michael Jackson? The runaway success of last years\u2019 Beauty Behind the Madness\u2014two No. 1 singles and over two million units sold in the U.S.\u2014seemed like it might finally force an answer to this question. And yet, Starboy, the Weeknd\u2019s sixth overall album and third for a major label, only further muddies the waters.\n\nInitially, there were signs that Starboy would represent a much-needed pivot, a rethinking of a sound and image that seemed to have run its course, from DIY mixtapes to the top of the charts. The album\u2019s lead video features Tesfaye murdering a past version of himself before taking a cross-shaped bat to a condo full of awards and sales plaques. Starboy, however, is hardly a dramatic reinvention\u2014if anything, it feels like a watered-down retread of the same old tropes. Beauty Behind the Madness managed to smuggle sleaze into the mainstream by refining Tesfaye\u2019s pop songcraft, even as it doubled down on the darkness. Starboy eases up on both fronts, recycling melodies, ideas, and even whole songs while presenting a sanitized version of the Weeknd that often lacks any real sense of perspective. It\u2019s a curious move for a guy who so decisively managed to succeed on his own terms.\n\nAs if to guarantee that it feels like a slog, Starboy is also overstuffed: over an hour of music stretching out over 18 songs, many of them bland. \u201cRockin\u2019\u201d sounds like a label executive\u2019s idea of what the Weeknd could be: inoffensive club pop tailor-made for office karaoke parties (\u201cI just want your body next to me/\u2019Cause it brings me so much ecstasy/We can just be rockin\u2019, yeah\u201d). \u201cFalse Alarm\u201d snatches defeat from the jaws of victory, its sublime opening harmonies devolving into a screamed chorus that\u2019s as contrived as Michael Jackson\u2019s bellow at the beginning of \u201cScream.\u201d \u201cSix Feet Under,\u201d a collaboration with Future, is essentially just a rewrite of the pair's much sharper \u201cLow Life\u201d (\u201cReminder\u201d also recycles the vocal melody from \u201cLow Life\u201d); both here and on \u201cAll I Know,\u201d the melodically-gifted rapper feels sorely underutilized. Kendrick Lamar\u2019s verse on the autotune-heavy \u201cSidewalks\u201d is characteristically dexterous but even he sounds a bit unenthused to be here. It\u2019s hard to blame him.\n\nThere are a few bright spots on Starboy, moments that feel guided by a stronger vision. Both of the Daft Punk collaborations are satisfying, if hardly groundbreaking; \u201cStarboy\u201d glides like a sleek, high-performance car, while \u201cI Feel It Coming\u201d sounds like a slowed-down version of \u201cGet Lucky.\u201d \u201cSecrets\u201d pushes the Weeknd\u2019s nocturnal sound into new wave territory, borrowing washes of clean guitar from Tears for Fears\u2019 \u201cPale Shelter\u201d and lifting the chorus from the Romantics\u2019 \u201cTalking in Your Sleep\u201d wholesale. \u201cTrue Colors\u201d sounds like a \u201990s R&B slow burner produced by Noah \u201c40\u201d Shebib (who was once apocryphally rumored to have ghost produced for the Weeknd). And \u201cOrdinary Life\u201d proves that Tesfaye is still more than capable of raising eyebrows, opening with a vivid description of fellatio behind the wheel before taking a hard left into petite mort fatalism (\u201cDavid Carradine, I\u2019ma die when I come\u201d).\n\nStarboy\u2019s most interesting song is barely even a song. The two-minute-long \u201cStargirl Interlude,\u201d finds Lana Del Rey reprising her role as Tesfaye\u2019s foil, relating a pornographic \u201cvision\u201d over a minimal backing track, before Tesfaye closes out the song by cooing, \u201cI just want to see you shine, \u2019cause I know you are a Stargirl.\u201d The brief snippet is filled with the sort of tension that\u2019s so lacking from most of Starboy, playing up the theatrics for which both artists are known. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve always been talking to each other through our music,\u201d Tesfaye said of Del Rey in an interview last year. \u201cShe is the girl in my music, and I am the guy in her music.\u201d Here, the pair embrace that meta-narrative, responding to their perceived lack of authenticity by retreating fully into the pop fantasy where their characters connect. It\u2019s a boldly self-aware move, one that smartly manages to wring art from artifice.\n\nStarboy could use a lot more of this kind of audacity or really, any kind of coherent storytelling that challenges, complicates or further illuminates our understanding of the unfeeling villain that Tesfaye has been playing since day one. Instead, we get a grab bag of difficult to reconcile contradictions: a \u201cParty Monster,\u201d on one track, a doe-eyed balladeer on another (\u201cDie for You\u201d). Tesfaye used to be near-obsessive about packaging projects that felt narratively whole\u2014after all, this is the guy who released an entire trilogy of interconnected albums in his first year. Starboy, by way of contrast, feels more like an opportunistic compilation of B-sides than an album. Who is the Weeknd? At this point, even the man behind the curtain might not know.\n\nSOURCE: https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22668-starboy/",

      "strDescriptionEN": "After Hours is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer The Weeknd. The album was released by XO and Republic Records on March 20, 2020. The project has been supported by three singles: \"Heartless\", \"Blinding Lights\", and \"In Your Eyes\". One promotional single has been released as well, the album's title track. It is The Weeknd's first studio album since 2016's Starboy, following the release of the 2018 EP My Dear Melancholy. The project is his first studio album to have no featured artists.\n\nBackground\nThe Weeknd first teased that he was working on a new album in November 2018, via a performance in which he told the crowd that \"Chapter VI was coming soon.\" On January 12, 2019, Tesfaye then proceeded to further tease the project and its sound by tweeting \"no more daytime music\" to fans, making media outlets believe that he was set to continue the darker music found in My Dear Melancholy. Following a trio of collaborative singles throughout 2019, on August 6, he further reassured fans that he was working on his fourth studio album. Then after a five month period of silence, on November 24 the single \"Blinding Lights\" was revealed through a Mercedes-Benz television commercial, with reports of \"Heartless\" surfacing a day later. The latter song then premiered on the seventh episode of The Weeknd's Memento Mori Beats 1 radio show on November 27, 2019. Which in the hours leading into the release of the radio show episode, The Weeknd announced on social media his return to music with the captions \"the fall starts tomorrow night\" and \"Tonight we start a new brain melting psychotic chapter! Let's go!\". Both singles were met with critical and commercial success, with \"Heartless\" becoming his fourth number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and \"Blinding Lights\" reaching number one in various countries worldwide. On February 13, 2020, The Weeknd revealed the title of the project \"After Hours\" through a 48 second teaser. A couple days after the announcement of the album's name, its release date of March 20, 2020, was shared through social media to accompany the title track's release as a promotional single. In the last week leading up to the album's release, After Hours' tracklist was revealed on March 17, 2020. On March 19, 2020, The Weeknd announced that the album is dedicated to long time fan and host of the popular XO Podcast, Lance, who died the night before. The album debuted alongside the eighth episode of Memento Mori on March 20, 2020, with The Weeknd also hosting a Spotify listening session upon its release.",

      "strReview": "\u201cI spend most of my days alone now,\u201d The Weeknd said of his solitary, workaholic ways in a recent interview. \u201cI don\u2019t like to leave my house too much. It\u2019s a gift and a curse but it helps me give undivided attention to my work\u2026 It distracts from the loneliness, I guess.\u201d It\u2019s a coincidence, certainly, but one very fitting that the first big album release of this period of global self-isolation should come from R&B\u2019s foremost Abel Tesfaye. It\u2019s a record free of features and full of probing self-reflection.\n\nTesfaye\u2019s last release, the 2018 EP \u2018My Dear Melancholy\u2019 , signalled something of a sonic retreat, a stylistic U-turn back to the downtempo noir-pop of his early work. It followed chart-propelling dabbles with disco and funk-indebted electro, as the Canadian crooner  transcended his initial cult-like status to make a surprisingly seamless crossover to the mainstream. Collaborating with the likes of Daft Punk, Lana Del Rey and Ed Sheeran, Tesfaye maintained his brooding and sleazy subject matter while scoring hits by pairing his signature falsetto to radio-friendly pop backdrops or upbeat nu-funk grooves.\n\nAhead of this new album release, The Weeknd promised \u201cno more daytime music\u201d and \u201ca new brain melting psychotic chapter,\u201d suggesting a much darker record than its immediate predecessor. But instead of opting for either arena-filling hits or the shadowy downtempo tunes of his early releases, Tesfaye instead switches between the two modes on \u2018After Hours\u2019, managing to produce his most all-encompassing record to date.\n\nThe jaunty \u2018In Your Eyes\u2019 (which comes with a euphoric, joyous and absolute killer sax solo) harks back to the sparkling bombast of 2016\u2019s \u2018Starboy\u2019, while \u2018Blinding Lights\u2019 has the same kind of glossy, cinematic feel as the best bits of \u2018Beauty Behind the Madness\u2019.  Lead single \u2018Heartless\u2019, a track admittedly a bit Weeknd-with-writer\u2019s-block, makes sure there\u2019s a club banger on offer, while \u2018Snowchild\u2019 is perhaps the most intimate we\u2019ve heard Tesfaye sounding in a while. It\u2019s a rare glimpse at Abel, the man, rather than his Weeknd persona.\n\nLyrically, it\u2019s mostly what you\u2019ve come to expect. Tesafye\u2019s music has long been concerned with the cyclical ups and downs of hedonism (after all, the whole concept arc of his breakthrough mixtape trilogy was pretty much the highs and lows of the party and the after-party), and the comedown feeling continues on the appropriately-named \u2018After Hours\u2019.\n\nBut, having recently turned 30, his long-running claims of wanting to abandon his old life sound a little more believable this time round, as he opens the first track \u2018Alone Again\u2019: \u201cTake off my disguise / I\u2019m living someone else\u2019s life / Suppressing who I was inside.\u201d Meanwhile, on the propulsive \u2018Too Late\u2019, Tesfaye sings: \u201cIt\u2019s way too late to save our souls, baby / It\u2019s way too late, we\u2019re on our own / I made mistakes, I did you wrong, baby.\u201d\n\n\u2018After Hours\u2019 stands as The Weeknd\u2019s strongest record in some time, but still there\u2019s a nagging question of what\u2019s to come. Because once you go pop, and then back to your roots, where exactly do you go next? That\u2019s precisely the problem The Weeknd faces with his next effort.\n\nSOURCE: https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/the-weeknd-after-hours-review-his-most-all-encompassing-record-to-date-is-also-an-existential-quandary-2632591",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Dawn FM is the fifth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter the Weeknd, released on January 7, 2022, through XO and Republic Records. Narrated by Canadian-American actor Jim Carrey, the album features guest vocals from Tyler, the Creator and Lil Wayne, and spoken word appearances from Quincy Jones and Josh Safdie. As the album's executive producers, the Weeknd, Max Martin and Oneohtrix Point Never recruited a variety of other producers such as Oscar Holter, Calvin Harris and Swedish House Mafia.\n\nA follow-up to the Weeknd's fourth studio album After Hours (2020), Dawn FM has been described as an upbeat dance-pop record rooted in 1980's synth-pop and heavily drawing from the era's new wave, funk and electronic dance styles. The album was preceded by the lead single \"Take My Breath\", which peaked at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100. In support of both Dawn FM and After Hours, the Weeknd plans to embark on the After Hours til Dawn Stadium Tour, scheduled to visit Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, and the Americas in the summer of 2022.\n\nBackground\nOn March 20, 2020, the Weeknd released his fourth studio album After Hours, during the beginning of COVID-19 restrictions. Primarily produced by the singer-songwriter, the featureless album was a commercial success and was met with generally positive reviews, with some music critics naming it his best work yet. Shortly after its release, the Weeknd began working on a new album. During an interview with Rolling Stone in September 2020, he stated that he \"might have another album ready to go by the time this quarantine is over\".\n\nThe Weeknd began to tease a new album in May 2021 during an interview with Variety, in which he stated \"if the last record is the After Hours of the night, then The Dawn is coming\". He continued to tease the album with the tentative title The Dawn during his acceptance speeches at the 2021 Billboard Music Awards and the 2021 iHeartRadio Music Awards. On August 2, the Weeknd released an initial teaser on his social media pages titled \"The Dawn is Coming\", which contained a snippet of a then-unreleased song. Later that day, in a partnership with NBC Sports and the 2020 Summer Olympics, he announced the album's lead single \"Take My Breath\", which was released on August 6.\n\nOn October 4, 2021, during an episode of his Apple Music 1 radio show, Memento Mori, the Weeknd announced that the album was complete, and that he was waiting on a \"couple characters that are key to the narrative\". He then described the characters as \"some people that are near and dear to me, some people that inspired my life as a child and some that inspire me now.\"\n\nOn January 1, 2022, the Weeknd teased a possible surprise album release in an Instagram post, which featured a screenshot of a text conversation he had with best friend and creative director La Mar Taylor. While they exchanged New Year's greetings, the Weeknd replied that \"Everything feels chaotic again. Music can heal and that feels more important than another album rollout. Let's just drop the whole thing and enjoy it with the people... XO.\" The next day, the Weeknd teased the album's arrival, tweeting \"wake up at dawn tomorrow\". On January 3, he formally revealed the album's official title through an album trailer and announced that it would be released on January 7. He subsequently announced the track listing through a second trailer on January 5.\n\nConcept\nDawn FM incorporates a \"psychedelic radio\" aesthetic with existential themes, similar to American experimental record producer Oneohtrix Point Never's album Magic Oneohtrix Point Never (2020), which the Weeknd appeared on and executive produced under his formal name. In an interview with Billboard on November 23, 2021, the Weeknd elaborated on these themes, saying:\n\nPicture the album being like the listener is dead. And they're stuck in this purgatory state, which I always imagined would be like being stuck in traffic waiting to reach the light at the end of the tunnel. And while you're stuck in traffic, they got a radio station playing in the car, with a radio host guiding you to the light and helping you transition to the other side. So it could feel celebratory, could feel bleak, however, you want to make it feel, but that's what 'The Dawn' is for me.\n\nArtwork\nThe standard Dawn FM album cover shows a dramatically aged and bearded version of the Weeknd in a dark setting with a small ray of light shining over his shoulder, symbolizing the album's themes of life transitioning to death. The collector's editions of the album, listed on the Weeknd's online store, features three alternate Dawn FM covers designed by American artist Robert Beatty, who also designed the album cover for OPN's Magic Oneohtrix Point Never. The HMV and Target exclusive alternate covers were also designed by Beatty.",
